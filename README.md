Since there is currently no declarative solution to alphabetize strings in a Salesforce Flow, this provides an invokable method to enable alphabetical text comparisons in your flow.


### Installation
Use the 'Deploy to SFDX' button to install into a scratch org or use the 'Deploy to Salesforce' button to install into a sandbox or developer org.
