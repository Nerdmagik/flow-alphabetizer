Currently there is no declarative solution to alphabetize strings in a Salesforce Flow.
This provides an invokable method to enable alphabetical text comparisons in Flows.


### Installation
Use the 'Deploy to SFDX' button to install into a scratch org or use the 'Deploy to Salesforce' button to install into a sandbox or developer org.
